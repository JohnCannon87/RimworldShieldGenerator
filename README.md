This mod adds a long range turret to the game.

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Turret fires 1 high powered beam, over walls and roofs but NOT over "thick roofs" (Simulating that it's ontop of a building for the turret but that it's not high over a mountain etc.)
[*]Charging animation before firing
[*]Requires battery power to fire, no ammunition but make sure you have enough power !
[*]Lots of values for the turret configurable in settings to tune to how balanced you want it to be
[*]Intercept incoming mortar shells and rockets (also configurable in the mod settings)
[*]Counts as a wall, both for Gravship reasons (It's airtight !) and for mounting things to it e.g. Wall Lights etc.
[/list]


[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
The interception logic is the main thing that will need to be integrated, for now it will intercept anything hostile that has the "flyOverhead" value (which should be all modded shells) and any projectile with the word "rocket" or "missile" in the name, which will hopefully catch a lot of other things.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
[list]
[*]None yet !
[/list]


[h2]The Point Of This Mod[/h2]
Part of a series of mods I've had for myself for a while that have either terrible graphics (that's not going to be fixed, unless someone gives me some better art to put in) or were atrociously balanced (So I've added the settings page)

[h2]Future Plans[/h2]
[list]
[*]None, this is complete for me so probably won't be adding anything unless someone gives me a really good idea.
