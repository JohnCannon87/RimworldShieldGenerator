[h2]RimworldShieldGenerator[/h2]
This mod adds a wall mounted shield generator for Gravships.

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Shield protects from all "projectiles", won't defend from Graser Beams etc.
[*]Drains battery power whenever it defends a shot
[*]Shield shatters on a shot that fully drains the battery, leaving it to cool down and making a large EMP explosion in the room with the shield
[*]Shield comes on automatically when a threat is detected on the map
[*]Change your shield colour and transparency ! (The edge will always be visible but you can remove the inner overlay if you wish)
[/list]


[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
Almost certainly isn't CE compatible and won't ever be sorry !

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
[list]
[*]None yet !
[/list]


[h2]The Point Of This Mod[/h2]
Part of a series of mods I've had for myself for a while that have either terrible graphics (that's not going to be fixed, unless someone gives me some better art to put in) or were atrociously balanced (So I've added the settings page)

[h2]Future Plans[/h2]
[list]
[*]Try and get the shield to also block lasers
